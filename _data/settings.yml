# About me
about-me: >
  **Hi there!** I'm a computational astrophysicist working in the
  [Institute for Computational Science](http://www.ics.uzh.ch/en.html)
  at the University of Zurich as a doctoral candidate.

  My interests are broad, and during my
  [academic career](/assets/files/cv.pdf)
  I dabbled in many research fields such as general relativity, cosmology, galactic dynamics, stellar formation, computational astrophysics, fluid dynamics, physical chemistry, molecular dynamics, and high-performance computing.

  When not doing sciency stuff or "hacking away" on my laptop, I'm most likely to be found on a climbing wall in my favorite
  [bouldering](http://minimum.ch/) or
  [climbing](http://griffig.com/) gyms
  in Zurich.

  Although I am not very good at it, I occasionally play guitar and rarely piano.
  However, what I'm very good at is drinking coffee, playing pool, and other things that encourage my procrastinative habits ðŸ˜….
