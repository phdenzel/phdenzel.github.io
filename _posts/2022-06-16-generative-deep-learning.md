On June 16 2022, I presented a short tech talk on "Recent Developments
in High-Resolution Image Synthesis". Since the reserved time for this
talk was rather short, it is meant for people who want to catch up on
the latest news in research around generative deep learning, and
already are familiar with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoregressive models, etc.

In order to make the presentation easier to follow (and for archival),
I used the `reveal.js` framework to turn my presentation slides into a
HTML/javascript website.
