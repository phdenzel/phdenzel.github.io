It's time for another one... a SKACH winter meeting in Bern.
On January 27, 2025, I held a talk about a new SKACH project at ZHAW (collab with UZH), titled "Lens Prior Matching With Latent Diffusion Models".
What's prior matching you ask? Never heard of latent diffusion? Find out by looking at the slides, or listening to my talk ;)!
