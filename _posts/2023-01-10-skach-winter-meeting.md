These are the slides for a short talk with the title "Deep learning
the mapping between SKA mock observations and hydrodynamical
simulations" at the SKACH winter meeting on January 12 2023. It is
meant as an introduction of our research for SKACH at the Centre for
Artificial Intelligence at ZHAW which started late summer in 2022.

In order to make the presentation easier to follow (and for archival),
I used the `reveal.js` framework to turn my presentation slides into a
HTML/javascript website.
