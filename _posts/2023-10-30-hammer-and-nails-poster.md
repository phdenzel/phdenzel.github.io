On October 30 2023, I presented a poster on the Hammer & Nails
conference in Ascona, displaying our ongoing work for the SKACH
consortium at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence at ZHAW. We're
using image-to-image translation cGANs with simulated maps of galaxies
to infer astrophysical properties, which would otherwise stay hidden
in observations by radio telescopes like the SKA... dark matter for
instance.
