These are the slides for a short talk with the title "Deep learning
domain translation between mock observations and hydrodynamical
simulations" at the Swiss SKA Days 2023 conference in Zurich. It
presents a diagnosis for the reason we had a hard time training our
generative image-to-image translation models on projection images of
IllustrisTNG galaxies.

In order to make the presentation easier to follow (and for archival),
I used the `reveal.js` framework to turn my presentation slides into a
HTML/javascript website.
