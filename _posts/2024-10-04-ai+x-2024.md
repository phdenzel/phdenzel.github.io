On October 04 2024, I attended the AI+X Summit 2024 in Zurich and gave a talk about the current state of Generative Artificial Intelligence. These presentation slides are special in comparison to my other blog post, as I generated each slide using an AI code generator! I used the Ollama StarCoder2 model in combination with aider-chat. Images were also mostly generated using Stable Diffusion or FLUX.1, and in the end I even show a deep fake of myself!
