These are the slides for a short talk with the title "Image-to-image
translation between SPH simulations and SKA mocks" at the SKACH spring
meeting on June 02 2023 in Geneva. It is meant as a status update of
our research for SKACH at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence at
ZHAW which started late summer in 2022.

In order to make the presentation easier to follow (and for archival),
I used the `reveal.js` framework to turn my presentation slides into a
HTML/javascript website.
