This post is a summary of a talk I was asked to give in front of my fellow PhD students.
It basically was a tutorial on shell scripting and dotfile integration.
I gave a live demo in which I demonstrated how I install my dotfile repository on a new machine.
Dotfiles set defaults for many different programs, and make personalization of these programs easy to back up.

#### Inspirations

-   linux background
-   I like to browse for [r/unixporn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) ;)
-   a tinkerer by nature
-   bending and breaking software is fun ([awk-raycaster](https://github.com/TheMozg/awk-raycaster))
-   food for your OCD monster
-   everybody likes pretty things


#### Shells

Before talking about dotfiles, system configurations and customizations,
we need to have a quick look at the basics, i.e. how we interact with the OS.
Here some important keywords:

-   ***terminal***, ***tty***, ***console***, and ***shell*** often used as synonyms
-   ***terminal*** is the text input and output environment, for UNIX equivalent with a tty or a collection of ttys
-   ***tty*** (short for teletypewriter) is a particular kind of device file which implements a number of additional commands (ioctls) beyond read and write (often directly connected to hardware devices via the kernel)
-   ***console***, sometimes a primary terminal directly connecting to the machine, appears to the OS as a kernel-implemented tty
-   ***Command-line interpreters (cli)***, or sometimes also synonymously labelled ***shells*** are consoles where users can issue commands
    -   in the early days, the only means of interaction with the machine
    -   ***interpreted*** language, most also support ***scripting***
-   many different ***kinds*** of shells:
    -   sh (Thompson or Bourne)
    -   csh (C-like)
    -   ksh (David Korn)
    -   bash (Bourne-again)
    -   zsh (Zhong Shao's username)
    -   fish (friendly-interactive)
    -   rsh/rbash (restricted)
    -   tclsh (tcl/tk commands)
    -   wish (tcl/tk gui version)
-   different shell ***types***:
    -   interactive shell (accepts commands *interactively*)
    -   non-interactive shell (usually spawned by shell scripts)
    -   login shell (login via SSH or terminal, usually interactive)
        -   non-login interactive shells read `.bashrc` files, but not your `.login` and `.profile`


#### Dotfiles

-   What?
    -   Files that start with a dot `.`, the most prominent example being `.bashrc`
    -   collection of files containing settings for various programs
    -   usually hidden in normal `ls`-ings, try typing `ls -ad ~/.*` in terminal

-   Why?
    -   why not?
    -   no, seriously&#x2026; it will improve your workflow drastically (if set up to your specifications)

-   Where?
    -   personal customizations in `~/.`, i.e. `$HOME/.`
    -   various basic configurations in `/etc/.`, e.g. `/etc/bashrc` (careful if you plan to change those!)

-   How?
    -   simply put them in your home directory
    -   almost all programs use dotfiles: git `.gitconfig`, ls `.dircolors`, curl `.curlrc`, emacs `.emacs.d/init.el`, vim `.vimrc`, python `.pythonrc.py`, matplotlib `.matplotlib/matplotlibrc`, etc.


##### My dotfiles

There are many resources offering dotfile configurations, setup and maintainance frameworks:

-   [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io/)
-   [github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles)
-   [homely.readthedocs.io/en/latest](https://homely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You can find my ever-growing dotfile collection here: [github.com/phdenzel/dotfiles](https://github.com/phdenzel/dotfiles).

    .USERINFO
    .bashrc
    .bash_profile
    .aliases
    .prompt
    .path
    .exports
    .functions
    .dircolors_macos
    .dircolors_linux
    
    .gitconfig
    .gitignore
    .pulls
    .macOS
    
    .inputrc
    .screenrc
    .wgetrc
    .curlrc
    .gdbinit
    .hgignore
    .editorconfig
    .hushlogin
    
    bootstrap.sh
    |-- bin
    |-- etc
    |-- utils
    |-- .emacs.d
        |-- server
    |-- .config/neofetch
    |-- installers
    |-- custom

And this is how it looks&#x2026;

##### Setting up a new machine

I work with lots of machines (currently about 6-7), some of them virtual.
The more machines you have to set up, the more you wish you had writen something to automate this process&#x2026;

1.  Install OS (and set up an internet connection)
2.  Install git (usually already installed, but old `git clone https://github.com/git/git`)
3.  Clone dotfile repository from GitHub `git clone https://github.com/phdenzel/dotfiles`
4.  Run install scripts depending on OS, e.g. `brew.sh` or `apt.sh`
5.  Bootstrap dotfiles `source bootstrap.sh`
6.  Install additional tools (via install scripts), e.g. `emacs_installer.sh` or `python`
7.  If the machine is permanent, install `Dropbox` and symlink all directories to `$HOME`
