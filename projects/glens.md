title: Gravitational Lensing

---

Galaxies changed our view of the Universe and of the nature of the
fundamental forces repeatedly. They are tracers of the Universe’s
large-scale structure and its evolution for the last 13 billion years
or more. They are also “factories" where cold hydrogen gas fuels the
formation of stars, which leads to the production of heavier elements,
and eventually to life. Moreover, it appears that the luminous matter
in galaxies only accounts for 1 to 5% of their entire mass, and the
rest is seemingly invisible. The exact nature of their “dark”
components is perhaps the gravest enigma of modern science. Exploring
and understanding galaxies, their formation, and evolution is
therefore of paramount interest to cosmology, particle physics,
astronomy, and astrophysics.


My research explores how models of galaxies can be incorporated with
observations of the strong gravitational lensing phenomenon in order
to test galaxy formation theories. Despite the unique circumstances
leading to lensing systems which provide the opportunity to unravel
otherwise hidden properties of their lensing galaxies, lens-modelling
attempts have yet to consistently yield quantifiable constraints on
galaxy formation scenarios. Conventional lens-modelling techniques use
a set of parameters to describe the form of lensing galaxies. Here are
3 examples of such gravitational lens systems illustrated (in
false-colors).

We generate and examine free-form lens models for 8 systems, and apply
measured time delays of lensed quasars in order to constrain the
cosmological parameter for the rate of cosmic expansion, the Hubble
constant, but also to optimize the lens models themselves.  We measure
a broad distribution of values for the Hubble constant with a median
of $$ H_0 =
71.8^{+3.9}_{-3.3}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} =
2.33^{+0.13}_{-0.11}\,\mathrm{aHz} $$.

Another particularly interesting study of an extraordinary lensing system is presented in [Denzel et al. 2020d](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/506/2/1715/6311822) for which lens models indicate a distinct type of galaxy, a fossil group galaxy, which is considered the final phase of a group galaxy’s evolution. For this galaxy, we mapped the stellar and dark-matter content, using a combination of stellar population synthesis and lensing models.

The red areas describe regions where stellar masses are high, whereas dark matter completely dominates the blue regions.

We also investigate drawbacks and issues of such free-form lens models in a blind-study with simulated lenses, in [Denzel et al. 2020a](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/492/3/3885/5706849). The study underlined a major limitation of lensing models:

The mass distribution leading to the lensed image configuration is
non-unique, and thus synthetic images can look (almost) identical for
completely different mass models.

While conventional techniques conveniently and efficiently generate
models, they remain rather simplified. Galaxy-formation simulations on
the other hand, are highly tuned to produce realistic galaxy models
from first principles. For this reason, we tested the plausibility of
utilizing such simulations for a direct comparison to lensing data. At
last, we propose a novel strategy in [Denzel et
al. 2020c](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/506/2/1815/6307035)
which efficiently matches projected galaxy models from simulations to
lensing observations and evaluates relative posterior probabilities of
the underlying galaxy formation scenarios. In future, such methods are
essential for upcoming wide-field surveys, as they will increase the
number of galaxy lenses, and thus the workload, possibly a
hundredfold.
